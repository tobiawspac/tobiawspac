## 🏆 Featured Projects

### [raspberry-pi-status-web-server](https://github.com/tobiawspac/raspberry-pi-status-web-server)
A dashboard that shows what your Pi is up to. Think of it as a tiny command center for your computer overlord. 🚀

### [PythonSecureCrypt](https://github.com/tobiawspac/PythonSecureCrypt)
Encrypt your secrets like a pro… or just feel fancy while doing it. 🔒

### [bugbounty-bot](https://github.com/tobiawspac/bugbounty-bot)
Automates boring stuff while you hunt for bugs. Basically, a lazy hacker’s dream. 🐛

### [js-mini-project](https://github.com/tobiawspac/java-script-)
Small experiments in HTML/JS because why not? 🤷‍♂️
